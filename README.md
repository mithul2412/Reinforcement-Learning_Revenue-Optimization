# Taxi Revenue Optimization with Deep Q-Learning and Enhanced Data Visualization

## Description

This project focuses on optimizing taxi service operations through the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, specifically Deep Q-Learning. Our goal is to enhance urban mobility and driver profitability by providing data-driven decision-making tools.

Key features of the project include:

- Implementation of a Deep Q-Learning model for taxi service optimization
- Empowerment of taxi drivers with AI-driven decision support
- Significant improvements in operational efficiency
- Reduction in urban congestion contributing to greener future
- Sophisticated data analysis and visualization using Google Cloud Platform and Tableau

Our research demonstrates marked improvements in service metrics and positive environmental impact.
